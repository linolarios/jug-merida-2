## I'm Tracing You ðŸ¤–

### WHEN -> 05/24/2022  on our youtube channel

> Microservices solved a few challenges from traditional architectures, but at the same time, they also introduced new ones. These challenges led to the rise of Observability and the requirement to track what is happening in your system. OpenTelemetry and Distributed Tracing come to the rescue and provide us with a set of events describing the operations being executed in our applications. Do not worry if you are not using Microservices. You can still use OpenTelemetry. In this session, you can expect multiple demos showing how to use OpenTelemetry in new and old applications alike, without even having to change your code!
